    "### 1. Introduction & Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately differentiate between these two types of animals. The dataset we will be using contains 25,000 images in total, with 12,500 images of cats and 12,500 images of dogs. We will preprocess and divide the images into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Keras, with Tensorflow as the backend, to implement and train the CNN. After training, we will evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using separate test data to measure its ability to generalize to unseen images."
